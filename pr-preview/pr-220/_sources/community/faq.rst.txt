FAQ
===

Answers to questions that come up repeatedly in the issue tracker
and on Discord. If you don't see your question here, check
:doc:`support` for where to ask.

Getting started
---------------

What hardware do I need to run FlashDreams?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FlashDreams targets recent NVIDIA data-center GPUs. The profiling
corpus on the :doc:`benchmarks page </models/index>` runs across
three devices — NVIDIA H100, GB200, and GB300 — and the
per-recipe latency numbers on each model page (e.g.
:doc:`/models/self_forcing`, :doc:`/models/lingbot_world`) are sourced
from the same set.

Any CUDA-capable GPU with enough memory for the chosen checkpoint
should run the streaming recipes; smaller GPUs may need to drop
multi-GPU recipes back to a single device. See the
:doc:`/quickstart/index` for the cheapest path to a working clip,
and the :doc:`benchmarks page </models/index>` for the profiled
configurations.

Which model recipes ship in the box?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eight first-party integrations ship under ``integrations/`` in the
repo. The :doc:`/models/index` page has the full list; in summary:

- :doc:`/models/self_forcing` — Streaming Wan 2.1 T2V (1.3B).
- :doc:`/models/causal_forcing` — Streaming Wan 2.1 T2V / I2V (1.3B).
- :doc:`/models/causal_wan22` — FastVideo Causal Wan 2.2 14B MoE T2V.
- :doc:`/models/lingbot_world` — Camera-controllable I2V world model.
- :doc:`/models/omnidreams` — HDMap-conditioned driving world model
  (the GTC 2026 closed-loop demo).
- :doc:`/models/flashvsr` — Streaming video super-resolution.
- :doc:`/models/wan21` — Bidirectional Wan 2.1 T2V / I2V reference.
- :doc:`/models/cosmos_predict2` — Bidirectional Cosmos-Predict2.5
  T2V / I2V reference.

Each model page has the canonical CLI invocation, checkpoint source,
multi-GPU command, and per-recipe knobs.

Installation and packaging
--------------------------

Why can I install ``flashdreams`` from PyPI but not the integration packages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only the core ``flashdreams`` package is published as a pure-Python
wheel on PyPI. Integration packages — ``flashdreams-self-forcing``,
``flashdreams-lingbot``, and the others listed in
`DEV.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/DEV.md>`__ —
are not published; they live under ``integrations/`` in the monorepo
and are designed to be consumed either as a workspace member or as
git-installable packages.

To install an integration directly from the repo:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "flashdreams-wan21 @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git#subdirectory=integrations/wan21"

   # or with uv
   uv pip install "flashdreams-wan21 @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git#subdirectory=integrations/wan21"

The rationale is in `DEV.md
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/DEV.md>`__: the
core ``flashdreams`` is the only stable, pip-installable surface; the
per-recipe wheels move at the upstream model's pace and stay
git-installable so they can pin against a known core commit.

Usage
-----

How do I plug in a new model recipe?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`/developer_guides/new_integration` guide walks the full
flow — what to subclass on the runner side, how the entry-point
registration works, and what the per-integration directory layout
looks like. The eight in-tree integrations under ``integrations/``
are the canonical references; pick the one closest in shape to your
new recipe and use it as a template.

The minimum surface is: subclass the right runner base, register the
slug via the ``flashdreams.runner_configs`` entry point, and (for
streaming runners) wire ``--total-blocks`` into the runner config.
:doc:`/developer_guides/new_integration` covers each step with the
exact ``pyproject.toml`` snippet.

Project and licensing
---------------------

Can I use FlashDreams commercially?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. FlashDreams is released under the
`Apache License 2.0 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/LICENSE>`__,
which permits commercial use, modification, and distribution under the
license's terms. Third-party model weights and datasets used with
FlashDreams may carry their own licenses — please check those
separately.

Contributing back is welcome but not required. See
:doc:`contribute` if you'd like to upstream a fix or improvement.
