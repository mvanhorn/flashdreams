Why FlashDreams?
----------------

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-reverse fd-split-asymmetric-reverse

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      A world model learns to generate and evolve an environment over time. In
      practice that usually means video, but the same idea extends to actions,
      state, audio, sensor input, and control signals. Serving one means keeping
      a session alive while input, model state, GPU inference, and output advance
      together, rather than producing a single static clip, which is what makes
      interactive simulation, robotics, autonomy, and game-like experiences
      possible.

      .. image:: /_static/diagrams/compare-offline-online-video-model-v2.jpg

         :class: zoomable

FlashDreams is built for that real-time case: a closed-loop world-model
demo, a driving simulator, an interactive scene rollout. Generating
high-quality video is not enough on its own. The runtime has to keep an
interactive session responsive while the model continues to advance the
world. That comes down to four things:

.. grid:: 1 2 2 4
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Low latency
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Keep the interaction responsive when controls, sensors, or user
      input change.

   .. grid-item-card:: High throughput
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Keep the GPU busy across autoregressive steps and multi-GPU
      execution.

   .. grid-item-card:: Steady streaming generation
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Stream frames or chunks at a steady pace while the session
      continues.

   .. grid-item-card:: World-state evolution
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Carry rolling state forward so the generated world evolves across
      steps.

Performance
-----------

Each tile shows the steady-state per-step speedup — post-warmup,
post-graph-capture — over a separate existing implementation of the
same model. Both runs use the same weights on the same GPU, so the
gain comes from FlashDreams' runtime alone; each tile names its
baseline below. Full methodology lives on the
:doc:`benchmarks page <benchmarks>`.

Supported Models
----------------

Streaming and autoregressive recipes emit per-step output with
sub-second latency once warm; bidirectional recipes are kept as
full-block parity references. Each model page carries the canonical
invocation, the checkpoint source, and the per-recipe knobs.
